This is the beginning of a Clyphx system for Bitwig

For the displaywindow to work you need to be on a Bitwig version before 5.2 (this broke, hopefully the devs will fix this)
In a clipname type for example ()SMW Hello world
-> This will display the message in a popupwindow
On an instrument track put a drumrack on the second position. (put an fx selector for example before it)
Now on that track write in a clipname ()LDR nameofyourdrumrackpreset
This will change the drumrack for that track

Set the BPM with ()BPM 128 for example 60.04 (doubles work also)
